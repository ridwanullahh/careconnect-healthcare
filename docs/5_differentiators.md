# Differentiators

- Trust‑First Core: visible verification, badges, license review signals, and moderation—improving quality and conversion.

- Practical, Governed AI: helpful, bounded, and clearly disclaimed; designed with review lanes and versioning.
- Integrated HMS + Marketplace: clinical operations and public marketplace live in a single, coherent suite.
- Solo Build, Modular Velocity: I’m building this MVP solo with a modular architecture to ship fast while preserving quality and safety.
- Privacy‑by‑Design: encryption, RBAC, consent versioning, audit logs, export/delete flows.
- Community Impact Built‑in: health education, verified causes (money and in‑kind), and Expert Q&A to channel help and knowledge where needed.
- Accessibility & Multilingual Readiness: inclusive by design with a plan for certified audits and language packs.
